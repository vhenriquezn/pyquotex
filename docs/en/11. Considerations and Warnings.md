## 🚨 Considerations and Warnings

### API Limitations

1. **Authentication and Session:**
   - The API uses a websocket-based authentication system
   - Sessions may expire and require reconnection
   - Possible blocking by Cloudflare due to multiple automated connection attempts

2. **Technical Restrictions:**
   - Requires Python 3.8 or higher
   - Dependent on the latest version of OpenSSL
   - Websocket connections may be unstable under certain network conditions

3. **Operations:**
   - There is a limit on the frequency of operations
   - Some functionalities may not be available in demo mode
   - Expiration times have specific formats that must be respected

### Best Practices

1. **Connection:**
```python
# Implement automatic reconnection
async def connect(attempts=5):
    check, reason = await client.connect()
    if not check:
        attempt = 0
        while attempt <= attempts:
            if not await client.check_connect():
                check, reason = await client.connect()
```

2. **Asset Management:**
   - Always verify if the asset is available before operating
   - Use the `get_available_asset()` function with the `force_open` parameter
   - Implement market hours validations

3. **Operations:**
   - Keep a record of all operations
   - Implement loss and gain limits
   - Do not perform multiple simultaneous operations without control

4. **Resource Management:**
   - Always close websocket connections after use
   - Implement timeouts in operations
   - Properly manage memory in long operations

### Common Error Handling

1. **Connection Error:**
```python
try:
    await client.connect()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Connection error: {str(e)}")
    # Implement reconnection or error handling
```

2. **Common Errors:**
   - `WebSocket connection failed`: Network or server issues
   - `Asset is closed`: Asset not available for operation
   - `Not enough money`: Insufficient funds
   - `Token rejected`: Expired session

3. **Solutions:**
   - Implement automatic retries for connection errors
   - Validate asset status before operating
   - Verify balance before performing operations
   - Handle automatic reconnection for expired tokens

### Security Considerations

1. **Credentials:**
   - Do not store credentials in code
   - Use environment variables or secure configuration files
   - Regularly rotate passwords

2. **Connection:**
   - Always use SSL/TLS connections
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Implement appropriate timeouts

3. **Data:**
   - Do not expose sensitive information in logs
   - Clear session data upon closing
   - Keep dependencies up to date

4. **Operations:**
   - Implement operation limits
   - Validate all inputs
   - Maintain audit logs

### Usage Recommendations

1. **Development:**
   - Start with a demo account
   - Perform thorough testing
   - Implement detailed logging
   - Keep the code modular

2. **Production:**
```python
# Recommended configuration example
client = Quotex(
    email=os.getenv('QUOTEX_EMAIL'),
    password=os.getenv('QUOTEX_PASSWORD'),
    lang="en",
    debug_ws_enable=False
)

# Implement error handling
try:
    check_connect, message = await client.connect()
    if check_connect:
        # Operation logic
        pass
    else:
        logger.error(f"Connection error: {message}")
finally:
    await cliente.close()
```

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement a logging system
   - Monitor websocket connections
   - Control the status of operations
   - Implement alerts

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Establish loss limits
   - Implement automatic stops
   - Diversify operations
   - Maintain detailed records

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. This API is for educational and development use.
2. Financial operations carry inherent risks.
3. The continuous functioning of the API is not guaranteed.
4. It is recommended to implement additional security measures.
5. The platform may change without prior notice.
